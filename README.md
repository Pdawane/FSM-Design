# FSM-Design

Objective: 
To design and implement FSM with ROMs and multiplexers for state transitions based on a two-bit input and a 50MHz clock
Developed FSM in Verilog using Xilinx tools, displayed state on FPGA board LEDs, implemented a two-second delay for input changes
Acquired skills in optimizing state management, debugging and validating designs, integrating components, handling real-time demands
